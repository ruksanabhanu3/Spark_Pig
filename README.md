# Spark_Pig
Querying on the given dataset using Spark RDDs and PIG queries.

perform the POC on three use cases i.e. single record lookup, filter and GroupBy accompanied with ordering in ascending order. So their respective problem statements are mentioned below. The following problems you will have to solve using Pig and Spark RDDs:

Fetch the record having VendorID as '2' AND tpep_pickup_datetime as '2017-10-01 00:15:30' AND tpep_dropoff_datetime as '2017-10-01 00:25:11' AND passenger_count as '1' AND trip_distance as '2.17'

Filter all the records having RatecodeID as 4.

Group By all the records based on payment type and find the count for each group. Sort the payment types in ascending order of their count
